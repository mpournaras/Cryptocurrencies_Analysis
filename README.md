# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose: 
A client asked for a list of tradable cryptocurrencies and wants to be able to pick them from a classification system.    

1. Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
2. Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
3. Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
4. Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
5. Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

## Results:
### The imported DataFrame before cleaning, 1252 rows of data:
